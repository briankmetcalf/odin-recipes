    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><b>Soft scrambled eggs</b> are the scrambled equivalent to a soft-boiled egg.
        Rather than cooking the eggs to being fully set and rubbery,
        soft-scrambling cooks the eggs just to the point where they're still a little gooey.
        It won't be for everybody, but I would highly suggest trying them on a good slice of toast, at least once.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 good quality eggs</li>
        <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Patience!</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt the butter in a medium-sized non-stick skillet over medium-low heat. We want the butter to pretty much coat the whole pan.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Whisk the eggs. When the butter is just barely bubbling, add the eggs to the pan directly in the center so that the butter gets pushed out to the sides. ZERO STICKAGE. This is good.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Watch for the edges to just barely start to set, and then gently swipe a spatula around the edges of the pan to create large soft curds. Donâ€™t flip the curds over. Continue this process, pausing in between to allow time for the eggs to cook but working quickly enough so as not to overcook the eggs, just gently pushing/folding the liquid eggs to form curds. The entire process should take 2-3 minutes or less.</li>
        <br>
        <li>When the eggs are barely set and you have some big folds of heavenly soft scrambled eggs laying in the pan, remove from heat. Serve on a breakfast sandwich or with your bowls or just by themselves. SO. AMAZINGLY. GOOD.</li>
    </ol>
